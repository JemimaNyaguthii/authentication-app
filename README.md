#  Jetpack Compose Login and Sign-Up Page
This project demonstrates the implementation of a login and sign-up page using Jetpack Compose, a modern toolkit for building native Android UI. The application provides a simple user interface for users to sign in with their username and password or sign up for a new account.

## Features
### Login Page
The login page allows existing users to authenticate by entering their username and password. It provides validation for empty username and password fields, displaying error messages if the fields are left blank. Users can also toggle the visibility of the password field to ensure the accuracy of their input.

### Sign-Up Page
The sign-up page enables new users to create an account by providing a unique username, email and a secure password. Similar to the login page, it offers validation for empty fields and allows users to toggle the visibility of the password field for input accuracy.
